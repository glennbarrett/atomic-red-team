# T1069 - Permission Groups Discovery
## [Description from ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/wiki/Technique/T1069)
<blockquote>Adversaries may attempt to find local system or domain-level groups and permissions settings. 

===Windows===

Examples of commands that can list groups are <code>net group /domain</code> and <code>net localgroup</code> using the Net utility.

===Mac===

On Mac, this same thing can be accomplished with the <code>dscacheutil -q group</code> for the domain, or <code>dscl . -list /Groups</code> for local groups.

===Linux===

On Linux, local groups can be enumerated with the <code>groups</code> command and domain groups via the <code>ldapsearch</code> command.

Detection: System and network discovery techniques normally occur throughout an operation as an adversary learns the environment. Data and events should not be viewed in isolation, but as part of a chain of behavior that could lead to other activities, such as Lateral Movement, based on the information obtained.

Monitor processes and command-line arguments for actions that could be taken to gather system and network information. Remote access tools with built-in features may interact directly with the Windows API to gather information. Information may also be acquired through Windows system management tools such as Windows Management Instrumentation and PowerShell.

Platforms: Linux, Windows, macOS

Data Sources: API monitoring, Process command-line parameters, Process monitoring

Permissions Required: User</blockquote>
